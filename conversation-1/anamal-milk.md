# Milk of animals

Why does kangaroo milk contain so much sugar?  
你認為為何袋鼠的奶糖分含量會這麼高啊？

For kangaroo pups, sugars are easier to digest.  
對於年幼的袋鼠而言，糖分比較好消化。

That's interesting. I wonder what it tastes like.  
真有意思。不知道味道嘗起來怎麼樣。

What about Armadillo milk? What's so special about it?  
那犰狳奶呢？它有什麼特別的地方？

It consists of a lot of calcium that helps the development of this animal's bones and shells.  
它富含鈣質，可以幫這個動物的骨骼和甲殼發育。

I see! I'll bet it's good for human babies, too!  
原來如此！我打賭，它對人類嬰兒也很好。

And flamingos. I know that they have pink milk. But why is it pink?  
還有紅鶴。我知道紅鶴奶是粉紅色的，但為什麼會這樣？

Because the pigments that give flamingos their pink feathers leach into the milk.  
因為賦予紅鶴粉紅色羽毛的色素滲透並浸入了乳汁。

Ah, that's why! Animal milk is so fascinating!  
原來是這個原因！動物奶真的太有趣了！
