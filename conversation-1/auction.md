Do you remember John, our former high school classmate?  
你還記得我們以前的高中同學John嗎？

Of course, I do. He is now a famous artist, isn't he?  
我當然還記得。他現在是位有名的藝術家，不是嗎？

Yes. He will be having his own art exhibition next week.  
Those arts will then be sold at auction, and the profit will be donated to the poor.  
沒錯。他下週會舉辦自己的藝術展。  
然後那些作品會在拍賣會上賣出，且得到的收益會捐給窮人。

Really? I have never bought a painting before. It must be expensive.  
真的嗎？我從來沒有買過一幅畫。那一定會很貴。

Neither have I.  
我也沒有。  
  
Generally, the bigger the painting, the more expensive it is.  
一般上，越大的作品就會越貴。

Sometimes its value also depends on the reputation of the artist, right?  
有時候它的價值也取決於藝術家的名聲，對嗎

Yes. And the status of the dealer is crucial too.  
對。而且經銷商的身份地位也很關鍵。
