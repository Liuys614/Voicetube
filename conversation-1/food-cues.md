# food cues

Hey, why are you frowning?  
嘿，你怎麼愁眉苦臉的？

I just found out that I've put on three kilos.  
我剛發現我又重了三公斤。

Ouch. You will need some good workouts then.  
你得好好健身了。

It’s probably the snacks in your surroundings. Maybe you can keep them out of sight?  
也許是你週遭的零食害的，要不然你試試把它們移到你視線外？

It’s hard; they are so tempting.  
太難了吧，它們很吸引人。

They are like food cues; you will continue caving in unless they are stored in a cupboard where you can’t see them.  
這就像是「食物暗示」，你要是不把它們放到你看不到的地方，像是櫥櫃哩，你就會一直屈服。

I'm going to work out later in the gym. Care to join me?  
我待會要去健身房運動，你要不要一起去？

Yeah! That would be nice.  
好啊！如果可以那樣最好。

Yay! Let’s get going!  
耶！我們走吧！
