# food cues

Hey, why are you frowning?  
嘿，你怎麼愁眉苦臉的？

I just found out that I've **put on** three kilos.  
我剛發現我又重了三公斤。

Ouch. You will need some good workouts then.  
你得好好健身了。

It’s probably the snacks in your surroundings. Maybe you can keep them out of sight?  
也許是你週遭的零食害的，要不然你試試把它們移到你視線外？

It’s hard; they are so tempting.  
太難了吧，它們很吸引人。

They are like food cues; you will continue caving in unless they are stored in a cupboard where you can’t see them.  
這就像是「食物暗示」，你要是不把它們放到你看不到的地方，像是櫥櫃哩，你就會一直屈服。

I'm going to work out later in the gym. **Care to join me?**  
我待會要去健身房運動，你要不要一起去？

Yeah! That would be nice.  
好啊！如果可以那樣最好。

Yay! Let’s get going!  
耶！我們走吧！
