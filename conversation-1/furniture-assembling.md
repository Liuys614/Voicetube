# Furniture assembling

Do you need some help assembling the furniture?  
你需要我幫忙組裝傢俱嗎？

I'm okay, I guess. The furniture comes complete with tools and instructions for assembly. **Should be easy-peasy**.  
我還可以啦我想。傢俱配有工具和組裝說明。應該能輕鬆自如才是。

OK then. But some of it doesn't seem easy to assemble.  
那好吧。但是其中一些似乎並不容易組裝誒。

You're not going to **do it all on your own**, are you?  
你不會要獨自完成全部的工作，對吧？

I'll work overnight to finish the assembling if needs be.  
假如有必要的話，我會熬夜完成所有傢俱的組裝工作。

That's a lot of work! **Don't wear yourself out**, will you?  
那也太多了吧。別累壞自己了，好嗎？

You're such a strong-willed guy. Anyway, if you need some help, I'll be a phone call away. All right?  
你真是個意志堅定的傢伙。好啦不管怎樣，如果你需要幫助，你一通電話我就來了，好嗎？

Cool. Thanks. This process will be an ideal opportunity for me to learn to live independently.  
讚唷。感謝。這過程將是我學習獨立生活的完美契機。

That's good. But still, **I'm very willing to** help in the future as well.  
是很好啦，但還是老話一句，我來我也是很樂意幫忙的唷。
