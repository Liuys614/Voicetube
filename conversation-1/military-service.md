# Military service

Are you concerned about joining the **military service**?  
你擔心去當兵入伍嗎？

Of course! What if life over there doesn't go so smoothly?  
當然了！萬一我在那邊過得不順利怎麼辦？

That is something to worry about.  
這確實很令人擔心。

But what do you worry about the most?  
但是你最擔心的是什麼事？

I'm afraid of the routine. I prefer to be spontaneous, living a life full of changes.  
我害怕要例行公事。我比較喜歡隨性、充滿變化的生活。

Yeah. I know what you mean, I like to be in control of my life.  
嗯，我知道你的意思，我喜歡掌控我自己的生活。

What would you like to do when your time's up?  
你當兵結束後想做什麼？

Well, I think I will travel a little bit, since by then I will have been limited to the borders of the camp the whole time.  
我覺得我會先去旅行一段時間，畢竟在那以前，我會一直被限制在軍營的邊界裡面。

That's a pretty good idea. Mind if I join you then?  
這是個好主意。你介意我跟你一起去嗎？
