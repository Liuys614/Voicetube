# new job

Buddy, what's up?  
怎麼了？

Nothing, I'm just sort of thinking about getting a new job.  
沒事，我算是有點想換新的工作吧。

Oh, didn't you just start last year?  
Why do you want to quit?  
你不是去年才剛開始做這份工作嗎？  
你為什麼想離職？

The distance I guess. I have to drive all the way to work every day.  
可能是因為距離吧我想。我每天必須大老遠開車到公司。

Oh right. I've heard it takes you more than an hour to commute.  
對。我聽說你要花一個多小時通勤。

Anything else besides commuting?  
除了通勤還有其他原因嗎？

I think I just need to take myself to the next level by getting another job.  
我覺得我只是需要透過換份工作把自己推到下一個新境界。

I agree. You only learn a limited number of things at that company.  
確實。你能在那間公司學習的東西很有限。
