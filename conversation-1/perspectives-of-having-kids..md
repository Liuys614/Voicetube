嗯，看起來我們的關係快要到終點了。

Why? What happened?

What did you talk about on the date?  
你們在約會時聊了什麼？

It turns out that **we have different perspectives on** having kids.  
原來我們倆在生孩子這方面有不同的想法。

Ah, that's a tough situation to be in.  
啊，在那樣的處境很辛苦。  
So, have you two decided to **end your relationship**?  
那麼，你們兩個決定分手了嗎？

Yes. No doubt that we love each other, but **it just won't work if we want different things.**  
是的。無疑地，我們還愛著對方，但如果我們要的東西不一樣，是不會有結果的。

**That's a shame. I'm sorry it didn't work out.**  
那真可惜。我很遺憾你們倆沒有好結果。
