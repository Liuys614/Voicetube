# prom invitation

So, did Monica reply to your prom invitation?  
所以，Monica 有答應你的舞會邀請嗎？

She said yes. I would never have asked her out if you hadn’t **egged me on**.  
她說好。如果不是你鼓勵我，我可能永遠不會去邀她。

That's great! Glad to help.  
那很好啊！很開心能幫上忙。  
Actually, I knew she would say yes because she told me she was looking for a partner.  
其實，我早就知道她會說好，因為她之前跟我說她在找一個男伴。

So, it could have been anyone, right?  
所以任何人都可以...對吧？

Cheer up, at least it's a start.  
打起精神，凡事都要有個開頭嘛。  
I guess you just have to take more action.  
我想你可能需要做更多行動了。

Yeah. At the prom, I will **make it plain that** I want to **go out with her**.  
好，我舞會的時候會跟她說明白我想跟她交往。

Go for it!  
加油！
