# Speech

I think Damon's speech was very well-prepared and enlightening. Why was he so down?  
我覺得 Damon 的演說有精心準備，也能啟發他人。但為什麼他看起來情緒低落？

He got some negative reviews, I guess. Even a little criticism might **undermine his confidence**.  
我猜他得到一些負面評價，只要有一點批評，都可能**打擊他的自信心**。

Oh, he was being such a **perfectionist** again. He was good enough!  
喔，他的**完美主義性格**又出現了。他明明已經夠好了。

He shouldn't think about that. Instead, he should just stop being a perfectionist.  
他不應該這樣想。他不應該再當一位完美主義者了。

I agree. His method of giving a speech is a paradigm for many to follow.  
我同意。他的演說技巧是許多人模仿的範例。

Exactly. I'd really like to know how he prepares for every speech.  
沒錯，我很想知道他如何準備每場演說。

By the way, which part of his speech did you enjoy the most?  
順帶一提，你最喜歡他演說的哪一個部分？

I liked the part where he accounted for the recent increase in violent crime.  
我喜歡他解釋最近暴力犯罪增加的那個部分。

**Same here**!  
我也是！
