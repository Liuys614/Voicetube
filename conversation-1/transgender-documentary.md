# Transgender documentary

Did you see that documentary about the transgender people on TV last night?  
你有看昨晚電視上有關跨性別族群的紀錄片嗎？

I did. The thing is, after watching it, I still don't know how to define the term "transgender".  
我看了，問題是看了之後，我還是不知道該如何定義「跨性別」這個名詞。

Me neither. Let's watch it again together. Maybe we'll get a better idea.  
我也是。我們一起再看一次吧，或許我們會更理解。

I think even after watching the documentary, there will be a lot more to learn. All I know is that however it is defined, it won't be black-or-white.  
我認為即使看完紀錄片，一定還有更多可以認識的地方。唯一確信的是，不管它如何被定義，都不會是能夠黑白分明的議題。

Given we're living in a society where the transgender people are suffering from stigma, we should try to find out what it really means.  
有鑑於我們生活在跨性別族群不斷遭受汙名化的社會，我們應該要試著了解其真正的意義。

Definitely. I'm going to do some research after rewatching the documentary.  
一定要的！再看一次紀錄片之後，我要去研究一下。

As we gain more understanding, the concept will become clearer.  
隨著我們獲得更多認識，這個概念就會變得更清晰。

Exactly. The definitions of the term transgender will become more nuanced.  
正是，跨性別組群的定義就會開始有細微差異了。

That's right. Once we know more, we will be less likely to offend people.  
沒錯，一旦我們知道多點資訊，我們就比較不會冒犯他人。
