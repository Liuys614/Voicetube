It's supposed to be dinner time, but now, even a cemetery is more lively than our restaurant! How are we going to win over more customers?  
現在應該是晚餐時段，但現在就連墓園都比我們的餐廳還要熱鬧！我們該怎麼吸引更多客人呢？

I think we need to work on publicity. Our restaurant is not in a good spot.  
我認為我們應該要努力宣傳。我們的餐廳地點不是很好。

Oh! I have an idea!  
How about this? We could drive a food cart downtown during rush hours!  
喔！我有個主意了！  
這樣如何？我們可以在尖峰時刻開著餐車到市中心。

Sounds great! We could develop dishes that are easy for customers to take with them.  
聽起來很棒！我們可以開發方便顧客帶走的新菜色。

Right, we should do away with dishes that need knives and forks.  
One more thing. We should offer them a discount for set courses.   
What do you think?  
沒錯，我們應該去掉需要用刀叉的餐點。  
還有一件事：我們應該要提供客人套餐優惠。  
你覺得呢？

Good idea! We can **cash in on** the **sides** __and drinks.  
好主意！我們可以從**小菜**和飲料中**獲利**。

Wow! The new menu is starting to take form. This looks promising.  
哇！新的菜單開始逐漸成型了。這看起來很不錯。
