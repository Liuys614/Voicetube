# Water shortages

Why do you take so long in the shower?  
你怎麼洗澡洗得這麼久？

It's the only time that I can relax a little.  
這是我唯一可以稍微放鬆的時刻。

Come on, it's a waste of water.  
Lots of people around the world don't have enough water. Do you ever think about that?  
拜託，這是在浪費水。  
世界上有很多的人都沒有足夠的水。你有想過這件事嗎？

Sure, but even if I used less water, they wouldn't have more of it.  
我知道啊，但即便我用比較少水，他們也不會有更多水用。

Maybe, but you're not **off the hook**!  
Water shortages are a growing problem, so you should remember how much value water has.  
也許吧。但這並不表示你就可以擺脫責任了！  
水資源缺乏的問題越來越嚴重，所以你應該要記住水源的重要性。

Alright. I'll take shorter showers.  
好吧。我會洗快一點的。

Good, that one step would make a big difference.  
很好，這一小步可能會帶來很大的改變。
