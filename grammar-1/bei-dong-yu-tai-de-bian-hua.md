# 被動語態的變化

被動語態可以從最基本的 `be 動詞`搭配`過去分詞`延伸成更複雜的結構，本課 `the true magic can be seen` 就是例子，由一個情態助動詞加上被動形成。

此外， `become`  或是 `get` 再加上一個`過去分詞`，也可以表示被動、或是呈現某種狀態的意思，像是本課的例句 `you become less bothered by things.`。

### 例句

Eventually the judge became convinced of her innocence.  
最終法官相信了她的清白。

That man got caught trying to shoplift a pair of jeans.  
那男在想偷走一件牛仔褲時被抓到。

The house looks old and dirty. It must have been abandoned for a long time.  
這房子看起來又破又舊，想必已經荒廢很久了。
