# 分詞構句

有時說話或寫作時常常會想要簡潔些，這時有很多方法，省略相同的主詞就是個最簡單的作法，分詞構句就是這樣產生的。 副詞子句改為分詞構句時，若要表明副詞子句的動作比主要子句的動作早發生，則用完成式來表達。比方這課例句：Having only lived in Canada for a few years, I was still getting used to the different cultures that made up my school. 表示 Since I have lived in Canada only for a few years, I was still getting used to the different cultures that made up my school. 有先後的感覺。再來看看多些例子：

#### 例句

Having won so many tournaments, Will chose to retire after his last game.

Will 贏了這麼多場比賽，他選擇在他最後一場比賽退休。

Feeling embarrassed, Joseph left the party earlier.

Joseph 感到羞恥並提早離開了派對。
