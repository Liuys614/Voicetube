# 關係代名詞與先行詞

關係代名詞最大的特點是結合兩個使用了「相同名詞」的句子，重複的這名詞叫「先行詞」，而關係代詞就是用來避免重複，用來「代指」這個名詞用的。我們拿 "And it can lead to wildfires like these ones, which burn massively out of control." 這句來看，關係代名詞 which 在這個關係子句中佔據的是一個「主詞」的位置，用來代指前面的先行詞 these ones \(wildfires\)，補述 these wildfires 的相關資訊。

### 例句

She has a cat, which accompanies her to work every day.  
她有一隻貓，牠每天陪伴她上班。

In the past, black children were not allowed to play with those who were white.  
黑人小孩以前不允許和白人玩。

Every morning I have a cup of coffee, which is from the café across the street.  
每天早上我都會喝一杯從對街的咖啡廳買來的咖啡。
