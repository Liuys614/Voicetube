# 連接詞 as though / as if

其實連接詞 as though 與 as if 意思相當，都用於做「比較」。As if 較 as though 更為常見，而口語化的說法就是我們常聽到的 like。as though 與 as if 所接的子句或是片語多用來表達一種「想像的情境」或是一種「可能不是真的，但未來有可能成真」的情況。由於子句常帶有「假設性質」，因此通常會用過去式或過去完成式來表達「與現在事實或者過去事實相反」的情況。然而近年來，越來越多人會直接以現在式、未來式表示這種假設情況，如本課的例句：When an apple enters a black hole, it seems as though it leaves the Universe, and all its quantum information becomes irretrievably lost.
